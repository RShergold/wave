ActionScript doodle - show microphone waveform


![Screen Shot](/ScreenShot.jpg "Screen Shot")


A little doodle I made to play around with raw microphone input using ActionScript. 
Please note I wrote this code with [textmate](http://macromates.com) and the 
[ActionScript 3 bundle](http://blog.simongregory.com/10/textmate-actionscript-3-and-flex-bundles/). 
So if you're using Flash Builder you may have to create a new project in your SDK and drop the code in.


I wrote the script by peicing together bits of other code as a learning exercise. If you want a more 
concise version take a look at 
[Fumio Nonaka's post](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/flcs5_features_microphone_event.html).


This is really my first tentative step in understanding the work of 
[Gerry Beauregard](http://gerrybeauregard.wordpress.com/), a must read for anyone interested in audio 
signals processing in ActionScript!
